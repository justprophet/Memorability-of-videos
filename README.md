# Memorability-of-videos
This project deals with the competition of Predicting Media Memorability Task at MediaEval 2018

It uses captions and video features to predict the memorability. 

#Following features have been used:

1.) Use of Count Vectorizer and TFIDF to create Bag of Words from captions.

2.) Use of HMP and Inception V3 features.

3.) Implemented Tensorflow using Keras to create a NN to train and test the model. First made separate models for each. 

4.) Created a simple Average Ensemble model and Weighted Ensemble model.
